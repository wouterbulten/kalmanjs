# Contrib folder

Kalman filters can be useful in a broad range of projects. Regularly I get questions whether KalmanJS is available in other languages than Javascript and sometimes another library is available. This contrib folder contains contributions by others translating the 1D Kalman filter, as implemented in this library, to other languages.

If you have a translation that you would like to share please feel free to submit a pull request.

**Disclaimer:** These implementations are often untested and are only placed here for convenience in the hope that they can be useful for other projects.
